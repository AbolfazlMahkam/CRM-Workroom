# ‚úÖ Figma-Based UI Project

Welcome to the Figma-Based UI Project! This project is a responsive and dynamic web application built using the design and layout from a Figma template. The application showcases intuitive user interactions and a modern interface, reconstructed using React.js.

# üîë Key Features

This web application offers the following functionalities:

* Dynamic UI Components:
Recreated the Figma-based design using reusable and modular React components.

* Interactive Elements:
Added functionality to interactive elements (buttons, forms, and more) for a seamless user experience.

* Dark Mode and Light Mode:
Implemented theme switching functionality to toggle between dark and light modes.

* Dynamic Data Fetching:
Integrated data fetching using react-query and axios to load data from a JSON file served via json-server.

# üîó Technologies Used

Front-End:

The front-end of this project is built using:

* Vite: For fast and optimized development build.

* React.js: For creating dynamic and reusable UI components.

* TailwindCSS: For rapid and responsive UI development.

* JavaScript (ES6+): For adding interactivity and logic to the application.

Data Management:

* JSON-Server: To serve data from a local JSON file.

* React Query: For efficient data fetching and caching.

* Axios: For handling API requests seamlessly.

# üì¶ NPM Packages Used

This project incorporates several essential npm packages to enhance functionality:

* React Router: For managing navigation and routing within the application.

* React Query: For data fetching and caching.

* Axios: For handling API requests.

# üöÄ Steps to Run the Application

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: ```git clone https://github.com/AbolfazlMahkam/CRM-Workroom.git``` or ```git clone git@github.com:AbolfazlMahkam/CRM-Workroom.git```.
